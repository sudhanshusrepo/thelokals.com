# Provider

This package contains the provider-facing web application for The Lokals Platform. The application is built using React and Vite. It allows service providers to manage their profiles, services, and bookings.

## Getting Started

To get started with the provider application, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed.

Once you have these installed, you can start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:5174`.

## Building the Application

To build the application for production, you can run the following command:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the production-ready assets.
